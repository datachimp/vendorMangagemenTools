The previous iteration of managing contract proposals was to sift through paper based documents with no uniform standard.
Then spending time looking for the information about the contractor from disparate sources.

This project provides a unique opportunity to modernize the way the government selects contractors.

The goal is to implement modern data tools to print out a document based report on the viability of the contractor bidding on the project based on the dataSources located here: https://github.com/datachimp/vendorMangagemenTools/tree/master/to-be/dataSources
