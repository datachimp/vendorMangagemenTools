This repository contains all the architecture, design and code artifacts required to understand vendorManagemenTools, the design, and ultimate technical implementation. It includes everything required to build a production environment for vendorManagemenTools, or smaller limited capability environments for the support of development, test, or demo activities.

The repository is split into two separate sections. The as-is contains materials to the current state of vendorManagemenTools. The to-be contains architecture, design and code covering for the new environment.
