venderManagemenTools is a project from the Integrated Award Environment (http://gsa.github.io/openIAE/). IAE's goal is to ease the process of examining potential contractors for government work. The Performance Work Statement: https://www.fbo.gov/utils/view?id=ae2653e905b49c96ba2ec74c83e498f1.


The previous iteration of managing contract proposals was to sift through paper based documents with no uniform standard.
Government agents would then spend time looking for information about the contractor from disparate sources. 

This project provides a unique opportunity to both modernize and open the way the government selects contractors.

The goal is to utilize modern data analyzing and collecting tools to print out a document-based report on the viability of a contractor bidding for a specific project by using the dataSources located here: https://github.com/datachimp/vendorMangagemenTools/tree/master/to-be/dataSources
